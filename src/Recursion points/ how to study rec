recursion : function calling itself

its helps us to solving bigger complex problem in simpler way

you can convert recursion solutions into iteration and vice versa

it consume space means space complexity is there which is not constant bcs of recursion calls

it hepls us in breaking down bigger problem into smaller problems


visualizing recursion

break it down into smaller problems  == recurrance relation
