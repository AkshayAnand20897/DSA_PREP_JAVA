recursion : function calling itself

its helps us to solving bigger complex problem in simpler way

you can convert recursion solutions into iteration and vice versa

it consume space means space complexity is there which is not constant bcs of recursion calls

it hepls us in breaking down bigger problem into smaller problems


visualizing recursion

break it down into smaller problems  == recurrance relation


When last function call is tail recursion


how to understand and approach the problem

1. indetify if you can break down problem into the smaller problem
2. write the recurrance relation if need it
3. drwa the recursive tree
4.about the tree
      a. see the flow the functions how they aregettinh stacked
      b. identify the flow of the left tree calls and right tree calls
